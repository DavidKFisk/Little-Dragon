# Little Dragon - Spot Micro

Little Dragon is my take on the project Spotmicro - robot dog. The original design was done by KDY0523 February 22, 2019 over on Thingiverse. 

All of the orginal STL files are available form Thingiverse. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283

As I modify or use another design for a part I will be adding those file here too. Eventually I would like to record the entire process of setting up the Little Dragon. 

Second version - coming soon
